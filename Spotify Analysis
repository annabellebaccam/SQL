-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I analyzed the data using SQL. 

-- What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, max_duration 
FROM (SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms) AS max_duration 
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name) AS artist_max_duration 
ORDER BY max_duration DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- What is the average danceability by artist and track? 
SELECT AVG(danceability),artist_name,track_name
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name,track_name
ORDER BY artist_name,track_name;

-- What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT avg(danceability),track_name
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY avg(danceability) desc 
LIMIT 10;
